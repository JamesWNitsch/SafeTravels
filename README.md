# SafeTravels
Work in Progress

Safe Travels is an application that is designed to help you plan any trip you make safely around any inclement weather.
The main activity asks for an origin and destination of the trip, and calculates up to 8 waypoints evenly spaced based 
on travel time. Waypoints can also be set by the user manually, with additional stopping time if they plan to rest.

Once the user enters the origin, destination, and any other locations they plan to stop at or pass through, the app displays
hourly weather data for up to 8 waypoints between the origin and destination, at the times when the user would be passing 
through. A seekbar at the bottom of the screen can modify the hourly data displayed at each waypoint of the trip- up to 
48 hours from the minimum arrival time of that given destination.
